# Python-and-Flask-Ex
Simple and to the point Python and Flask microservice practice.

## Virtual Environment
Start by installing Flask in a virtual environmnet, e.g. virtualenv. This can be downloaded from [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv).

I created a directory for this project (e.g. python-flask-ex) and created and activated a virtual environment called venv.
```
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

The simplest way to install Flask:
```
pip install flask
```

## Creating a Web Application
Quick example of a simple web application is the file [app.py](app.py), which can be ran using the following commands:
```
chmod a+x app.py
./app.py
```
